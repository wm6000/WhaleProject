# Whale Project

This project aims to visualize gray and blue whale sightings along the West Coast and how they intersect with global shipping density.

## Project Motivation

I am interested in whales and this project was a great way to learn more about them. 

1. How do Gray and Blue Whales intersect with global shipping routes?
2. How do Gray and Blue Whales intersect with shipping routes in the Los Angeles port.
3. How do Gray whales intersect with global shipping routes depending on the month?


## Website

There is one .ipynb file(Whale_Notebook.ipynb). It generates 3 maps that are displayed in my website blog: https://willswebsite.herokuapp.com/whales

## Installation:
Dependencies:
- [Python Version: 3.11.3]
- [branca==0.6.0]
- [folium==0.14.0]
- [geopandas==0.13.0]
- [numpy==1.24.3]
- [pandas==2.0.1]
- [rasterio==1.3.6]
- [shapely==2.0.1]




## Usage:
Run the Whale_Notebook.ipynb script to generate the map visualizations. You may need to download the file to trust the notebook which will then show the map.

## Data:
The whale sighting data was obtained from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab (MGEL) at Duke University: [OBIS](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/)

The Global Shipping Density was obtained from the World Bank: [Global Shipping Traffic Density](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037580/Global-Shipping-Traffic-Density)
