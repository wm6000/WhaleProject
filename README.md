# WhaleProject

This project aims to visualize gray and blue whale sightings along the West Coast and how they intersect with global shipping density.

There are three .ipynb files. They each generate a folium map that is displayed in my website blog: https://willswebsite.herokuapp.com/whales

## Usage:
Run each .ipynb script to generate the map visualization. You may need to download the file to trust the notebook which will then show the map.

## Data:
The whale sighting data was obtained from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab (MGEL) at Duke University. [OBIS](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/)
The Global Shipping Density was obtained from the World Bank
