# Whale Project

This project aims to visualize gray and blue whale sightings along the West Coast and how they intersect with global shipping density.

## File Descriptions:
There are three .ipynb files. They each generate a folium map that are displayed in my website blog: https://willswebsite.herokuapp.com/whales

## Installation:
Dependencies:
Python Version: 3.11.3
branca==0.6.0
folium==0.14.0
geopandas==0.13.0
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.1
rasterio==1.3.6
shapely==2.0.1



## Usage:
Run each .ipynb script to generate the map visualization. You may need to download the file to trust the notebook which will then show the map.

## Data:
The whale sighting data was obtained from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) and the Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab (MGEL) at Duke University. [OBIS](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/)
The Global Shipping Density was obtained from the World Bank
