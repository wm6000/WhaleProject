# WhaleProject


This project aims to visualize gray and blue whale sightings along the West Coast and how they intersect with global shipping density.

There are three .ipynb files. They each generate a folium map that is display in my website blog. 


The code loads gray and blue whale data from CSV files and creates a map using Folium. The map has two separate layers for each month of gray and blue whale data, respectively. Each whale sighting is represented by a circle marker on the map. In addition, the code creates a layer for reroute recommendations, which are represented by orange lines on the map.


Usage:

Run each .ipynb script to generate the map visualization. You may need to 

Data
